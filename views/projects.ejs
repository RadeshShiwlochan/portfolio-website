	        I love creating projects based on applications I could see myself using to make my day more efficient. DayPlanner is one of the projects I created, and is a RESTful API that allows users to organize and plan their day. The idea came from having to use multiple apps on my phone to get the information that I need to start my day. The app features traffic and weather information, a calendar, the ability to make notes as reminders. DayPlanner was developed using Node.js, Express.js, Bootstrap, CSS Grid, HTML5 and CSS3. You can view the code for this project <a href="https://github.com/RadeshShiwlochan/Day-Planner">here.</a>.

	        Another project I developed is PicSnap, which is a web application that is modelled after instagram. The app's main functionality is allowing users to upload pictures to their profiles. The app uses an API called Cloudinary, which allows for uploading of image files, where they are stored in the database. This was one of my first projects using Node.js and Express and as such, I do plan to do some optimizations and clean up to the code. This project was built utilizing Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, HTML5 and CSS. You can view the code <<a href="https://github.com/RadeshShiwlochan/picSnap">here.</a>
