	        <h3>About Me</h3>
	        <p>
	        	I am a full stack developer for a startup company called SyncIoT where our code stack is Node.js, MongoDB, D3.js, Bootstrap, HTML5 and CSS3. I love to code because I enjoy building software and seeing it come to life. It is truly satisfying to see the code you have written; work the way it was intended to. I enjoy solving challenges using my programming skills and learning new languages and frameworks. I am confident with the knowledge of my computer science degree and my experience I have gained thus far, I would a strong asset to any company.

	        	I graduated with a master of arts in computer science in May 2017 from the City University of Queens College. It was during my last semester as an undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics that I found my love for computer science. My first computer science class, introduction to C++, was fortunately a requirement for my math degree. It was this class that sparked my love for programming because I love applying the logic and analysis skills I gained while majoring in Math. After I graduated in May 2015, I was eager to continue my studies in computer science and enrolled in the Queens College computer science master program. During the summer of 2016, I also interned for a start-up company called MyMavens. While there, I worked on the companyâ€™s main web application utilizing Node.js, MongoDB, and bootstrap to create an app that allows users to find restaurants based on their personalized food preferences.

	        	My personal goal is to become a highly proficient software developer. I would love to work for a company at a position in which I grow as a software developer, continuously learn new tools, technology and face new challenges so that I can improve at my profession. The opportunity to learn from senior engineers and developers would be an invaluable experience that can propel my career.
